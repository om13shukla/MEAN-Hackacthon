## Phase-2 (Time: 4 Hours)
    Challenges: 
    1. - Connect to NoSQL DataBase:  
            ===> Connection to MongoDB and 105 calls at every **0.5 sec interval** 
              
    2. - Provision to CRUD the data:
            ===> Done, A small NodeJs and Angular Service provides a way to Create Read and Update the data.
            
    *Winning SPeach:  NodeJS was be my biggest concern. Understanding middlewares, callbacks, and the 
                error handling on top of Express especially is tougher then it seems at first.
                Lot of unkown terretory. Although given time, is easy to master. Thnak you *
